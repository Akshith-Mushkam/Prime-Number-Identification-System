# Prime-Number-Identification-System
This Python code implements an Optimized Prime Number Identification System (PNIS). It efficiently checks if an integer is prime by using a single O(sqrt of n)  trial division function that returns the smallest factor (or 0 if prime). It includes an interactive command-line interface.
